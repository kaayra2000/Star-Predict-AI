These shirts were inexpensive, so my expectations are possibly unreasonable in this price range. To be honest, they were a bit thinner than I expected. Not overly thin, but somewhere between medium and thin. I don't expect them to last as long as the other shirts I purchased. They are starting to lose their shape after a couple of months of use, while the others from about a year and a half ago are still generally going strong. I'm not a fan of the black text tagless design. Mostly because it is difficult to find black text on a dark-colored shirt. In theory, the front should be how I folded it, and a search unnecessary. However, before coffee, this is more of a challenge than one would expect. I think I would buy a higher thickness shirts instead.",

And when I take them off at the end of the day, they're not \"moist\" so the wicking must be doing its job.  The 2XL ones I have fit nicely as well, without another shirt overlapping them.  I have a set of straight black XL Gildan shirts that I use for under my work shirts that are a bit more \"crispy\" than this set, I don't know if I just need to break them in or wash them a bunch more times; but they have a feeling like the fibers are \"tight\" whereas this set (multiple colors) are softer and \"billowy-er\" where you feel like you could move around easier in them.  The dark blue XL I found just now does feel \"harder\" than the dark blue 2XL, but it's still softer than the black XLs I have - so it might just be a case of needing to work out the fibers and send it through a washer-dryer series a few extra times.",

Over all quality is very good and form factor is good after a wash. Most box store manor brand (one with the fruit) will shrink significantly and not hold form and look all wrinkled. Shrinkage is 5% after washing in cold and low dry. Might be an issue is you wash in hot or warm with normal dry cycle. Likely to shrink 10%.  Cons: Like many brands today sizing is an issue with smaller sizes; shirt designs in this category is totally inconsistent. Sizing for small tend to run more like fitted or even slim. With Gildan the waist is extremely tight and I felt like a sausage even before washing. Granted I have gained a little weight during Covid but not that much. I washed one just to see the shrinkage if I decide to purchase a size up. Just as a note many of my other brands in small still fit fine. Other review have commented on the sizing issues also.",

So, for convenience, I ordered these, since the reviews seemed to indicate they were pretty good and the material content is almost identical to what I usually buy. I am a female - but prefer to buy men's t-shirts for casual wear; I always found them to be more comfortable than t-shirts made for women. I also found that men's t's are usually made much more durable than those made for women - and last for years. However, when these came in I was disappointed to see how thin the material felt and how sheer they were. Sheerer than any men's t-shirt that I have ever seen. I also found the shape quite different - compared to most men's t-shirts that I own. I am guessing, however, the thinness may be great for someone wanting to keep cool - so I gave it two stars for that.",

I’m 59 years old and don’t do heavy “construction“ work around my home so it’s always just light yardwork and these T-shirts can’t hold up to that.

They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public.
